# Biomaker Cellular Automata Game Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a Biomaker Cellular Automata (CA) system into the existing Game of Life project using Godot and C#. The new system will simulate a complex environment where each cell has multiple properties such as type, structural integrity, age, and various nutrients.

## Goals
- Extend the current Cellular Automata to support multiple properties per cell.
- Create a more immersive and complex simulation for players to interact with.
- Ensure the system is flexible enough to allow for future expansions.

## Game Mechanics
- **Cell Properties**: Each cell will have properties such as cell type, structural integrity, age, earth nutrients, air nutrients, and agent ID.
- **Nutrient Cycles**: Cells will consume and regenerate nutrients from the earth and air.
- **Aging and Lifecycle**: Cells will have a lifecycle that includes birth, aging, and death.
- **Structural Integrity**: Cells will have structural integrity that can be affected by external factors.
- **Cell Types**: Different cell types with unique behaviors and interaction rules.

## Technical Design

### 1. Cell Class Extension
- Extend the `Cell` class to include new properties.
- Implement methods for handling the lifecycle of a cell.

### 2. Grid Initialization
- Initialize the grid with default values for the new cell properties.
- Set up a randomization function for cell properties if necessary for the initial state.

### 3. Update Logic
- Update `GridController.cs` with new rules for cell interactions and property changes over time.

### 4. Visualization
- Modify the `_Draw()` method to visualize the different states and types of cells.
- Consider adding textures or additional sprites to represent complex states.

### 5. User Interaction
- Update `InputManager.cs` to allow users to interact with the new cell properties.
- Implement UI elements for users to inspect and modify cell properties.

### 6. Optimization
- Profile the existing code to find bottlenecks.
- Optimize the simulation loop and rendering code for better performance.

### 7. Debugging Tools
- Develop in-game tools for live inspection and modification of cell properties.
- Implement logging for easier tracking of the cell state changes and interactions.

### 8. Agent Behaviors
- Create a behavior system for different cell types based on `AgentId`.
- Script individual behaviors for different types of cells.
