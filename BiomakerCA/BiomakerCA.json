  "CellTypes": {
    "Void": "Represents emptiness, non-interactive",
    "Air": "Intangible, propagates air nutrients, spreads to adjacent Void cells",
    "Earth": "Physical, propagates earth nutrients, affected by gravity",
    "Immovable": "Physical, unaffected by gravity, generates earth nutrients",
    "Sun": "Intangible, generates air nutrients",
    "OutOfBounds": "Indicates limits of the cellular automata grid"
  },
  "AgentSpecificTypes": {
    "AgentUnspecialized": "Initial state, consumes little energy",
    "AgentRoot": "Absorbs earth nutrients from Earth cells",
    "AgentLeaf": "Absorbs air nutrients from Air cells",
    "AgentFlower": "Performs reproduction, consumes more energy"
  },
  "CellBehaviorRules": {
    "Gravity": "Earth and Agent cells fall if there's an intangible cell below",
    "StructuralIntegrity": "Prevents cells from falling, cells inherit and decay this value from neighbors",
    "Aging": "Cells age and can die unless they reproduce",
    "EnergyProcessing": "Nutrients generated by Immutable/Sun materials, absorbed by Roots/Leaves, cells dissipate nutrients over time",
    "Perception": "Cells perceive neighboring cells in a 3x3 grid",
    "Operations": "Cells perform parallel and exclusive operations",
    "Reproduction": "Agent Flower cells can trigger reproduction under certain conditions"
