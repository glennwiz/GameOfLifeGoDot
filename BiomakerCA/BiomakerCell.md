### Cell Types
1. **Void**: Represents emptiness and can transform when interacted with by other cells.
2. **Air**: An intangible material spreading air nutrients and propagating through Void.
3. **Earth**: A physical material affected by gravity, propagating earth nutrients.
4. **Immovable**: Unaffected by gravity, this material generates earth nutrients and structural integrity.
5. **Sun**: An intangible material generating air nutrients.
6. **Out of Bounds**: Observed at the world's edge, indicating the grid limit.

### Agent-Specific Cell Types
7. **Agent Unspecialized**: The initial low-energy state of an agent.
8. **Agent Root**: Absorbs earth nutrients from Earth cells.
9. **Agent Leaf**: Absorbs air nutrients from Air cells.
10. **Agent Flower**: Performs reproduction, consuming more energy.

### Environment Logic
- **Gravity**: Affects Earth and Agent cells, causing them to fall if there's an intangible cell below.
- **Structural Integrity**: Prevents cells from falling due to gravity, with cells inheriting and decaying structural integrity values from neighbors.
- **Aging**: Cells age over time, with a reset in the aging counter only through reproduction.
- **Energy Processing**: Nutrients generated by Immutable and Sun materials are diffused and absorbed by Roots and Leaves. Agents dissipate nutrients over time and die without them.

### Perception
Cells, both material and agent, perceive their 3x3 neighborhood, including the types, states, and agent IDs of neighboring cells. This perception is crucial for differentiating between organisms.

### Cell Operations
1. **Parallel Operations**: Safe simultaneous operations, including updating internal states, changing specialization, and nutrient distribution.
2. **Exclusive Operations**: Potentially unsafe simultaneous operations, affecting neighboring cells. They are resolved by atomic commits to avoid conflicts.
3. **Reproduce Operations**: Specialized operations for reproduction, requiring sufficient nutrients and specific conditions like adjacency to Air cells.

### Agent Logic
Agent logic is defined by three functions governing the agent's behavior in parallel, exclusive, and reproduce operations. This logic must be vectorizable for efficient implementation and scalability. The complexity of Biomaker CA implies that trivial models or initializations are unlikely to result in a viable, reproducing organism.
